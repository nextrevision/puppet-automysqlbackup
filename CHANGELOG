* 2013-08-27 0.2.1
Summary:
This release heavily refactors the automysqlbackup class and adds a new
definition for automysqlbackup::backup. This allows multiple backups to be
configured spread across multiple config files. Doing this also allows values
to be passed in from Hiera via the "config" variable in the automysqlbackup
class.

Bug fixes:
- Lint error fixes (thanks zsprackett)

Features:
- Able to define multiple backups (thanks rhysrhaven)
- Able to pass in data from Hiera and create backup resources
(thanks rhysrhaven)
- Specify a custom cron script to be run

Incompatible Changes:
- Calling the automysqlbackup class directly from a manifest is no longer
supported. You must use the "automysqlbackup::backup" definition as illustrated
in the examples. All parameters should work consistently so all that is needed
is to simple change from "class {'automysqlbackup': }" to
"automysqlbackup::backup {'default': }".
